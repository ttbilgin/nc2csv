Sure, I will try to explain the mathematical fundamentals of the Gradient Boosted Tree method using equations and formulas in LaTeX format. Here is a brief overview:

- The goal of the Gradient Boosted Tree method is to find a function $F(x)$ that minimizes a given loss function $L(y, F(x))$, where $y$ is the true label and $x$ is the input vector.
- The function $F(x)$ is represented as an additive expansion of $M$ base functions $h_m(x)$, which are usually regression trees. That is, $$F(x) = \sum_{m=1}^M h_m(x)$$
- The base functions $h_m(x)$ are learned in a greedy, stagewise manner, by fitting the negative gradient of the loss function at each iteration. That is, $$h_m(x) = \arg\min_h \sum_{i=1}^N L(y_i, F_{m-1}(x_i) + h(x_i))$$ where $F_{m-1}(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{m-1} h_k(x)$ is the function learned at the previous iteration.
- The final function $F(x)$ is obtained by adding a shrinkage factor $\nu$ to each base function, which controls the learning rate and reduces overfitting. That is, $$F(x) = \sum_{m=1}^M \nu h_m(x)$$
